# Ox_Bike - Bike Spawner using Oxlib
Welcome to Ox_Bike, a bike spawner script built with the power of Oxlib!

Please note that my menu might appear different from yours because I've recently redesigned my Ox_Lib. If you're searching for something different I also made a menu like this in menuv, you can find a version I've posted on my GitHub.

Check out the visual preview of Ox_Bike below:
